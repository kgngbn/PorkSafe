# PorkSafe: A Mobile Application for Freshness or Spoilage Detection of Pork using Image Processing with Authority Notification

This thesis project is focused on enhancing food safety in the Philippines, particularly in the pork industry. With the Philippines ranking prominently in pork consumption, production, and importation globally, ensuring meat quality and safety is paramount. Consumers' purchasing decisions are influenced by various factors, including taste, appearance, and food safety standards. However, challenges such as meat contamination persist, necessitating preventive measures throughout the supply chain. In this project, we aim to leverage machine learning, specifically image processing and recognition, to address these challenges. By developing a smartphone application capable of analyzing raw pork meat images, detecting spoilage, and providing alerts, we strive to empower consumers and authorities in safeguarding food safety and quality. 

This study generally aims to develop a mobile application for identifying spoilage in pork meat using image processing and Convolutional Neural Network.
Specifically, this study aims to:
1. develop a CNN-based image classifier for identifying spoiled pork meat and integrate it into a smartphone app for real-time user feedback on pork quality.
2. create a mobile application that can scan meat samples and promptly notify users if the meat is spoiled or fresh.
3. provide reports through a dashboard for appropriate action from authorities.
4. evaluate the application's overall performance and quality based on the ISO 25010 Standard.
